FRANCHISE AGREEMENT TEMPLATE

This is a placeholder for the franchise agreement template PDF.

In a real implementation, this would be a professionally designed PDF document with:
- Company letterhead
- Legal terms and conditions
- Franchise details
- Signature blocks
- Date fields

The system will automatically insert the franchisee's name at a designated position in the document when generating the personalized agreement.

For implementation:
1. Replace this text file with an actual PDF template
2. Update the coordinates in the generatePdfWithUserData function in digitalAgreementController.js to match where the name should appear
3. Ensure the PDF has appropriate form fields or spaces for signatures
